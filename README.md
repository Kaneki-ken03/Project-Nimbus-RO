# About Nimbus Token Project and How To Claim.

Nimbus is a open source and free to claim Commodity representation of value token that we hope will be adopted and used by all.

***

(Polygon MainNet contract deployed: )

***

**No Presale/ICO for Nimbus will be held;** we intend to launch an abundant and cheap coin for new users to use in the form of a commodity representation of value token; that may grow in value over time.

***

Nimbus Can Be Claimed in several ways:

- new user claim: once by any new user at a rate of 100 tokens. limited to 200,000 new users.
  
- whitelist claim: once by any whitelisted user at a rate of 500,000 tokens. whitelist will be limited to 100 users.

- liquid staking: once per 30 days by any token holder with a minimun balance of 100 tokens or more; user will be minted 1% of their total held balance.(up to 12% APR)

***

How To Claim:

to claim we recommend going to https://polygonscan.com/token/0x51aeaf0eaf0919da5bf5865ac6a0f4d270de060f#writeContract // correct this after launch (this is a test contract not the offical contract)

then click "connect to web3" button to connect your wallet to polyscan; and then call/write any of the following functions from the list of functions on the contract:

New User Claim(function #) ,

Whitelist Claim(function #),

Liquid Staking(function #),

***

the development team will maintain a donations wallet that will be set up to receive donations in the form of Nimbus or MATIC.

//correct address once launched Donation Wallet Address: 0x05932c5B4d79c8b0bFc02Bb3b1309E67Daae8BcD (Only send MATIC or Nimbus to this Address.) //correct address once launched
MATIC received from donations will be allotted in a 75%/25% split and the Nimbus token donations will be allocated 50%/50%

75% MATIC collected along with 50% of the Nimbus tokens will be added to the liquidity pool; while the other 50% of Nimbus will be burned once a months.

the remaining 25% MATIC collected from donations will be used to support further project development; this 25% will be subtracted from the total MATIC balance once a month.

the tokens liquidity pool will be listed on Pancake Swap or similar exchanges.

**Buit in Deflatinary Mechanisim**

- there is a set platform/contract burn fee applied to all user transactions; this fee is 2.5% of tokens being transfered and is sent by the sender in addition to the "transfer amount" to the 0xDead address to be burned automatically(this can be changed in the future and will only be changed after permitted by community vote.)

- there is a set platform/contract charity/dev fee to all transactions; this fee is 2.5% of tokens being transfered and is sent by the sender in addition to the "transfer amount" to the set charity wallet address. (this can be changed in the future and will only be changed after permitted by community vote.)

- the total platform/contract transfer fees are 5% of tokens being sent at time of writing.(this can be changed in the future and will only be changed after permitted by community vote.)

***

**we will burn 100% of LP tokens received from listing on UniSwap.**

- this will prevent the initial liquidity that was provided by the development team from ever actually being removed.
  
(we will update this Page with the transaction hash reffrencing the burn on block explorer here after listing)

**to protect our users and our project: we reserve the right to Blacklist wallet addresses that misuse/abuse this projects clam functions; our dedicated security team monitors block explorer on a day to day basis to ensure contract abuse and misuse does not occur. things we look for that violate our terms of contract** **use; holders claim being called by one wallet address and tokens being transferred from the holders wallet to another wallet to call holders claim again; if we notice this behavior the security team will temporarily pause the contract and it will result in an immediate blacklist of the new token holder address by** **our security team. this will lock the tokens in the blacklisted wallet preventing buying, selling, token transfers to and from the address, as well as preventing the use of any claim features in our contract. from a development standpoint this Pause and Blacklist feature are intended to be failsafe security** **measures to ensure the project and its users are protected from misuse/abuse.**
